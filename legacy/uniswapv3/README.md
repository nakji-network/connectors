# UniswapV3 Connector

## UniswapV3
Uniswap is a protocol for creating liquidity and trading ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. It eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for fast, efficient trading. Where it makes tradeoffs - decentralization, censorship resistance and security are prioritized. Uniswap is open-source software licensed under GPL.

Uniswap v3 introduces:

Concentrated liquidity, giving individual LPs granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. Individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against

Multiple fee tiers , allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk
